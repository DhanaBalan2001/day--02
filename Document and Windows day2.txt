Difference between Document and Windows Object:

Document:

1.Represents the HTML document: The Document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.

2.Contains DOM elements: It provides access to all elements within the document, such as <div>, <p>, <span>, etc.

3.Methods for DOM manipulation: It offers methods like getElementById(), getElementsByTagName(), and querySelector() to interact with DOM elements.

4.Properties for document metadata: It includes properties like title, URL, and cookies related to the document.

5.Used for content manipulation: Developers use the Document object to create, modify, and delete HTML elements and their attributes.

Windows Object:

1.Handles timing events: It handles timing events using methods like setTimeout() and setInterval() for executing code after a specified delay or at regular intervals.

2.Storage management: It manages client-side storage using localStorage and sessionStorage to store data persistently or temporarily.

3.Handles cross-origin communication: It facilitates communication between windows or frames belonging to different origins using methods like postMessage().

4.Controls browser navigation: It controls browser navigation using methods like history.back(), history.forward(), and location.reload().

5.Global variables and functions: It hosts global variables and functions that are accessible throughout the application, including across multiple documents within the same window.
